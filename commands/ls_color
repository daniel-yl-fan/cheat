Blue = 34
Green = 32
Light Green = 1;32
Cyan = 36
Red = 31
Purple = 35
Brown = 33
Yellow = 1;33
Bold White = 1;37
Light Grey = 0;37
Black = 30
Dark Grey= 1;30

The first number is the style (1=bold), followed by a semicolon, and then the actual number of the color, possible styles (effects) are:

0   = default colour
1   = bold
4   = underlined
5   = flashing text (disabled on some terminals)
7   = reverse field (exchange foreground and background color)
8   = concealed (invisible)

The possible backgrounds:

40  = black background
41  = red background
42  = green background
43  = orange background
44  = blue background
45  = purple background
46  = cyan background
47  = grey background
100 = dark grey background
101 = light red background
102 = light green background
103 = yellow background
104 = light blue background
105 = light purple background
106 = turquoise background
107 = white background

All possible colors:

30  = black
31  = red
32  = green
33  = orange
34  = blue
35  = purple
36  = cyan
37  = grey
90  = dark grey
91  = light red
92  = light green
93  = yellow
94  = light blue
95  = light purple
96  = turquoise
97  = white

You can also change other kinds of files when using the ls command by defining each kind with:

bd = (BLOCK, BLK)   Block device (buffered) special file
cd = (CHAR, CHR)    Character device (unbuffered) special file
di = (DIR)  Directory
do = (DOOR) [Door][1]
ex = (EXEC) Executable file (ie. has 'x' set in permissions)
fi = (FILE) Normal file
ln = (SYMLINK, LINK, LNK)   Symbolic link. If you set this to ‘target’ instead of a numerical value, the color is as for the file pointed to.
mi = (MISSING)  Non-existent file pointed to by a symbolic link (visible when you type ls -l)
no = (NORMAL, NORM) Normal (non-filename) text. Global default, although everything should be something
or = (ORPHAN)   Symbolic link pointing to an orphaned non-existent file
ow = (OTHER_WRITABLE)   Directory that is other-writable (o+w) and not sticky
pi = (FIFO, PIPE)   Named pipe (fifo file)
sg = (SETGID)   File that is setgid (g+s)
so = (SOCK) Socket file
st = (STICKY)   Directory with the sticky bit set (+t) and not other-writable
su = (SETUID)   File that is setuid (u+s)
tw = (STICKY_OTHER_WRITABLE)    Directory that is sticky and other-writable (+t,o+w)
*.extension =   Every file using this extension e.g. *.rpm = files with the ending .rpm

LS_COLORS="$LS_COLORS:di=1;33"  .bashrc 

# show ls colors, run in a new shell

dircolors --print-database

dircolors -b >/dev/null
IFS=:
for ls_color in ${LS_COLORS[@]}; do # For all colors
    color=${ls_color##*=}
    ext=${ls_color%%=*}
    echo -en "\E[${color}m${ext}\E[0m " # echo color and extension
done
echo

The database in question is a globally readable file which can be overridden depending on your terminal type.
The database file is initially set to /etc/DIR_COLORS then overridden with one of the following.
The first being the least precedent and the last being the most.

/etc/DIR_COLORS.$TERM
/etc/DIR_COLORS.$TERM
$HOME/.dircolors
$HOME/.dircolors.$TERM
$HOME/.dir_colors
$HOME/.dir_colors.$TERM

This configuration file has several options:

COLOR - ether:
tty (add colour to ls when output is on the command line)
all (all colours to ls on the command line and when piping i.e. ls > file.txt will have colour coding information in it)
none (switch off)
OPTIONS - strictly not related to LS_COLORS. This allows you to add extra options to the ls command.
TERM - one line per terminal type that supports colour.
EIGHTBIT - 1 (on) or 0 (off) to allow 8-bit output.
and finally the colour definitions for file type and file extensions.

On most systems the ls command has been aliased to use the coloured option by default:
alias "ls=ls --color=auto"
